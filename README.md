# API: File Metadata Microservice

This is a file metadata API built for [a freeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/file-metadata-microservice).

### User stories:

1. I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
2. When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response.
